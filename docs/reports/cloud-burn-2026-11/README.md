# Cloud-burn 2026-11 reports

- AR06 - Adversarial review of platform/abf_station/launch.py - 14 surviving findings; the top one is that a samplesheet cell outside the path-column heuristic (file:// URI, ../ path) passes both read-root locks and every cloud checker.
# Cloud-burn reports, 2026-11

- AR11 - Adversarial review of compose, catalogue, module sources, pipeline actions and pipeline launch (`platform/abf_platform/`): 10 surviving findings, led by a P1 where a map-only channel is rendered as `[[id: ...]]`.
- AR12 - Adversarial review of `platform/abf_launch/`: 19 surviving findings, two P1 (samplesheet cells escape the path gates; a resume after a relaunch gets a name the agent cannot match).
- AR13 - Adversarial review of `hooks/`: 24 surviving findings, four P1 Safety Net bypasses (glob in a middle path component, here-doc run by `source`/`eval`, MCP launch with a top-level `input`, identity-change gate spellings).
- AR08 - Adversarial review of cloud_cost.py, su.py, web_cost.py: the SU card and cloud cap miscount (default_site pricing, partial sums, in-flight runs at $0, unpriceable tasks dropping a run), 13 surviving findings.
- AR09 - Adversarial review of web.py and web_board.py: exponent-form numbers sent as text, lost-run Resume offers the action layer refuses, SVG served without a sandbox CSP, shared login bucket behind a proxy, 15 surviving findings.
- AR10 - Adversarial review of web_settings.py, web_launch.py, web_upload.py, uploads_web.py, actions/uploads.py: same-name uploads overwrite registered dataset objects, resume-edit refuses its own untouched box, unregistered batches after job prune, 15 surviving findings.
- MU04: Mutation run on platform/abf_platform/cloud_cost.py. 54 mutants, 30 killed, 20 real survivors (mostly the monthly cap check and odd-number pricing), all killed by a proposed new test file.
- MU05: Mutation run on platform/abf_platform/http_auth.py. 59 mutants, 28 real survivors (session table, ContextVar reset, discovery document), all covered by a proposed new test file.
- MU06: Mutation run on platform/abf_station/rules.py (FORBIDDEN unit). 40 mutants, 20 killed, 20 survivors, all killed by 15 proposed unit tests; no change to rules.py needed.
