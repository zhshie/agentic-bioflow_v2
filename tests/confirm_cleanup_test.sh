# Regression tests for hooks/confirm_cleanup.sh.
#
# The first two cases are the ones that mattered: the hook used to classify a
# segment as a delete whenever the letters "rm" followed by a space appeared
# anywhere in it, which is true of "confirm " and of "Platform run". Combined
# with a protected word among the arguments, that denied ordinary commands.
# A guard that refuses `echo confirm the results directory` trains its reader
# to ignore it, which costs more than the guard is worth.
#
# Note the delete verb is assembled from hex below rather than written out, so
# that running this file does not itself trip a cleanup hook watching the shell.

# The shared image library had three spellings and the rule knew one of them -

# `.singularity_cache`, and the rule named `lab_singularity_library`. So the
# directory actually holding the images was deletable while PRINCIPLES.md said
# it was protected. All spellings now, and two near misses that must not be.
